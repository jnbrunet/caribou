/**
 * Implements a Conjugate Gradient method for solving a linear system of the type Ax = b.
 *
 * When using no preconditioner, no actual system is built by this component, meaning that
 * the matrix A, and the vectors x and b are never accumulated into memory. Instead, this
 * solver relies on the vectors stored in the mechanical objects of the current scene context
 * graph. The multiplication of the matrix A and a given vector x is computed by accumulating
 * the result b=Ax from ff.addDForce(x, b) of every forcefields acting on a given mechanical
 * object.
 *
 * When using a preconditioner, the matrix has to be assembled since the preconditioner needs
 * to factorize it. In this case, the complete system matrix A and dense vector b are first
 * accumulated from the mechanical objects of the current scene context graph. Once the dense
 * vector x is found, it is propagated back to the mechanical object's vectors.
